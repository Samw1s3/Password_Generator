# Password_Generator
Password generator that can be customised for user requirements.
This website is the base design for my future web applications to live to allow my future employers to see my existing work and see if it aligns with what they are looking for in employees.

## Description
This website contains a password generator, to allow the user to create unique passwords to a criteria of their choice. They will start the process by clicking on the generate button. Then they will be prompted to set a length for the password. It must be between 8 - 128 characters and if not then it will return undefined and an alert will tell them what to do. Following this they will need to confirm if they want number, upper case and lower case letters and special characters.  If they do not like the password they can click generate password and select a different criteria until they get a password that they are happy with.
